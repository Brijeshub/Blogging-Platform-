            <p>The landscape of customer experience (CX) technology solutions is becoming more complex each year. At [A], our Content Engineers, Content Strategists, and Content Intelligence teams regularly evaluate new software and workflow solutions in this sector to help narrow down the plethora of choices and help our clients make more informed decisions. We believe knowledge-sharing is critical to building the next generation of intelligent customer experiences (ICX), so the team at [A] has created two highly informative videos on the customer experience technology landscape and selection process.</p>
           <h3 className='text-4xl mb-2 mt-3'>Core Discussion Topics</h3>
            <p>The first video touches on the technology involved with delivering intelligent customer experiences via multiple channels, from authoring through delivery. This involves much more than just content management. Cruce Saunders (Founder and Principal at [A]) leads the discussion that covers what these pieces of technology are, how they fit together, and how content flows through them.</p>
